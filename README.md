Personalized Recommendation System using Reinforcement Learning

This project explores how recommendation systems can adapt to users over time instead of relying on static rules. The system is designed to learn from user feedback and continuously improve the quality of recommendations based on observed behavior.

A simulated user environment is used to represent different user preferences and reactions to recommended content. Each interaction produces a reward that reflects how well the recommendation matched the user’s current interests. This allows the model to learn which actions lead to higher long term engagement.

Two reinforcement learning approaches are implemented. Q Learning is used to learn a value based policy, while a neural network based policy model is used to study continuous action selection. The training process includes reward tracking and policy updates so different strategies can be compared. This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to real world personalization systems where user preferences change over time.
